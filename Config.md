# Config

Admin menu, config files, placeholders, logs, and the developer API.

---

## The Admin menu

`/eco admin` opens the shop editor, settings, and player balances. Operators can also use `/eco addmoney`, `/eco setmoney`, `/eco removemoney`, and `/eco removeplayer`.

### Shop editor

Browse categories and click an item to change it.

- **Category editor**: right-click a category to change its displayed name, color, icon, visibility, or whether it takes part in dynamic pricing. Deleting a category moves all of its items to `misc` and sets their buy prices to `0`.
- **Add item**: select any item in the game or one from the inventory. Custom names, enchantments and container contents are stored with the entry.
- **Buy Price / Sell Price**: the price of one item. `0` disables that direction. When dynamic pricing applies to the item, the Buy Price button also shows the Base Buy Price (what you configured), the Current Buy Price (what players pay right now) and the Current Multiplier.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: per-item switch to opt this item out of dynamic pricing even while it's enabled server-wide.
- **Bulk Amount**: how many a shift-click buys or sells.
- **Category**: which page of the shop the item appears on. `blocks.wood` creates a sub-page.
- **Delete**: removes the entry.

### Dynamic shop pricing

Optional, off by default (`dynamic_prices_enabled`). When on, every buy price (except items or categories that opted out) is scaled by:

```
current price = base price × current active-player median balance / starting balance
```

Sell prices are never affected, and the configured price is always the base price used in that formula. The scale factor is clamped between `dynamic_price_min_multiplier` and `dynamic_price_max_multiplier`, cached, and recalculated at most once an hour. "Active" players are those who logged in within `dynamic_price_min_active_days` days, so accounts that never come back and sit at the starting balance don't drag the median down.

Opt out a whole category from its category editor, or a single item from its item editor, in the Shop editor above.

### Settings

Paginated, and covers every option in `config.json`: starting balance, daily reward, daily sell limit, tax rate, PvP money loss, thousands separator, log retention, order/auction expiration hours, max active orders/auctions per player, dynamic shop pricing, and switches for the shop, auction house, orders, selling, the balance sidebar and transaction logging.

### Players

Select any player, online or not, to give, take or set their balance, remove them from the economy, or override their max active orders / max active auctions. Right-click either limit to clear the override and fall back to the server default.

---

## Config files

On a server, config and player data are stored in `config/economycraft/`: `config.json`, `webhook.json` and `prices.json` at the top, balances, auctions, orders, deliveries and player activity (for dynamic pricing) under `data/`.

In singleplayer each world gets that same folder inside its own save, at `saves/<world>/economycraft/`.

Default shop prices are listed on [Prices](Prices.md).

### `config.json`

| Key                              | Default | Description                                                                                                                     |

| `taxRate`                        | `0.1`   | Tax on trades and orders, as a decimal (`0.1` = 10%).                                                                           |
| `pvp_balance_loss_percentage`    | `0`     | Share of a balance the killer takes on a PvP death. `0` disables it.                                                            |
| `scoreboard_enabled`             | `false` | Show the balance sidebar. Off in this local edition.                                                                            |
| `shop_enabled`                   | `true`  | Enable the fixed-price shop.                                                                                                    |

| `balance_separator`              | `"."`   | Thousands separator. Only the first character is used, so `","` gives `$1,000`.                                                 |
| `transaction_log_enabled`        | `true`  | Record every balance change to a daily log file.                                                                                |

| `order_expiration_hours`         | `168`   | Hours before an unfulfilled order expires and its escrow is refunded. `0` disables expiration.                                  |
| `auction_expiration_hours`       | `168`   | Hours before an unsold auction listing expires and its item goes to deliveries. `0` disables expiration.                        |

| `dynamic_prices_enabled`         | `false` | Scale shop buy prices with the active-player median balance. See [Dynamic shop pricing](#dynamic-shop-pricing).                 |
| `dynamic_price_min_multiplier`   | `0.5`   | Lowest allowed price scale, even if the median balance craters.                                                                 |

| `dynamic_price_min_active_days`  | `30`    | Players must have logged in within this many days to count toward the median. `0` includes every player.                        |

### `webhook.json`

| Key                  | Default  | Description                                            |
|----------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `webhook_enabled`    | `false`  | Post transactions to `webhook_url`.                    |
| `webhook_url`        | `""`     | Discord-compatible incoming webhook URL.               |
| `webhook_min_amount` | `0`      | Skip webhook posts for transactions smaller than this. |

### `prices.json`

One entry per shop item, keyed by item id:

```json
{
  "minecraft:diamond": {
    "category": "ores",
    "stack": 64,
    "unit_buy": 800,
    "unit_sell": 200
  }
}
```

`category` accepts `top.sub` for a sub-page. `stack` is the shift-click bulk amount. `unit_buy` and `unit_sell` are the price of one item, and `0` disables that direction.

Items from installed mods are added automatically with their mod ID as the category and both prices set to `0`.

Further keys are written by the editor:

- `components` holds NBT for custom items such as a name, enchantments or shulker contents. JSON keys must be unique, so a second variant of the same item takes a `#label` suffix, e.g.: `minecraft:shulker_box#loot_rare`. The suffix is stripped on load and is not shown to players.
- `"removed": true` marks a bundled default that was deleted, so it is not restored on the next start. Delete the entry to restore it.
- `"dynamic_price_enabled": false` opts that item out of [dynamic shop pricing](#dynamic-shop-pricing) even while it's enabled server-wide. Omitted (defaults to enabled) unless the item was opted out. The `_categories` block at the bottom takes the same key per category.

## Placeholders

EconomyCraft can expose economy data to other mods through [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api) on Fabric, or the unofficial [Placeholder API NeoForge](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api-neoforge) port on NeoForge.

Both are optional and not bundled. The mod works without them, but the matching jar for your version and loader must be in the server's `mods` folder for these placeholders to resolve.

| Placeholder                              | Description                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `%economycraft:balance%`                 | Raw balance of the viewed player, e.g. `1000`.                                             |
| `%economycraft:balance_formatted%`       | Balance with currency symbol and thousands separator, e.g. `$1.000`.                       |
| `%economycraft:balance_short%`           | Balance abbreviated to 1 decimal place, e.g. `$1.2k`.                                      |
| `%economycraft:daily_sell_remaining%`    | How much the player can still earn from selling today. Shows `∞` if the limit is disabled. |
| `%economycraft:top_name 1%`              | Name of the player ranked `1` on the balance leaderboard (`1` = richest).                  |
| `%economycraft:top_balance 1%`           | Raw balance of the player ranked `1`.                                                      |
| `%economycraft:top_balance_formatted 1%` | Formatted balance of the player ranked `1`.                                                |
| `%economycraft:top_balance_short 1%`     | Abbreviated balance of the player ranked `1`.                                              |

The `top_*` placeholders take the rank as an argument, e.g. `%economycraft:top_name 3%` for third place. Ranks beyond the number of players resolve as invalid.

## Transaction logs and webhook

### Log files

One JSON-lines file per day, at `logs/transactions-YYYY-MM-DD.log` inside the config folder. Each line is a single JSON object:

```json
{"time":"2026-08-19T13:45:12.345Z","type":"PAYMENT_SENT","player":"<uuid>","player_name":"Notch","counterparty":"<uuid>","counterparty_name":"Dinnerbone","amount":-500,"balance_before":1500,"balance_after":1000,"source":"economycraft:player_payment"}
```

`detail` is an extra, optional field on shop, auction and order entries describing what was actually bought, sold or fulfilled, e.g. `"detail":"12x Iron Ingot"`. Entries logged before this was added won't have it.

Files older than `transaction_log_retention_days` (default `7`) are deleted automatically. Setting it above 90 logs a console warning on start.

### Webhook

Configured through `webhook.json`, see [webhook.json](#webhookjson) above.

When `webhook_enabled` is `true`, each transaction is POSTed as `{"content": "<message>"}` to `webhook_url`.

Set `webhook_min_amount` to only notify on larger transactions.

---

## Developer API

The normal EconomyCraft jar includes API v1 for other server-side mods. There is no separate runtime API mod to install.

The API covers balances and payments, official money formatting, read-only item prices, leaderboard data and successful balance-change events. Public classes are under `com.reazip.economycraft.api.v1`.

See the [Developer API wiki](https://github.com/PhilipB06/EconomyCraft/wiki) for setup, examples, behavior rules and the complete reference.
